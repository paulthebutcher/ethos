# Session Notes - February 6, 2026

## Working on
- Ethos site setup and log system

## Progress
- Created standalone ethos site with same styling as public-brief
- Built /projects page with project cards, status badges, thesis display
- Built /log page with methodology framework and log entries
- Set up log-session skill for capturing notes throughout sessions
- Established weekly workflow: session notes → Sunday compile → publish

## Decisions
- Keep ethos site separate from guildry and public-brief repos
- Use JS arrays for content (LOG_ENTRIES, PROJECTS) - simple, version controlled
- Weekly log cadence with Monday reminder
- Discovery-first approach for Phase 1 vs rigid upfront schemas

## Learnings
- AI development 10-20x faster than traditional estimates
- Cowork doesn't have built-in scheduled tasks yet - using calendar reminders instead
- Build guides can be overspecified - let conversations reveal what matters

## Notes
- User has UX background - wants to define Phase 1 through conversation not rigid PRs
- Ethos site documents the "Solo AI Product Incubator" meta-model
- Guildry is first Layer 1 project in the incubator
